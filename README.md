# DS en ligne - Online Math Exam Website

Personal project by Louis Caubet, 2021. Its purpose was to learn React.JS.
Unfinished.

## Concept

The website offers a student and a teacher interface. The student can see what exams he has to complete and complete them in the time set by the teacher.
The teacher can create and edit exams, and receive answers of students to mark them.
